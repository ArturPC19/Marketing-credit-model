# Data-Driven Marketing Strategy for Banking Products

University project focused on applying data mining techniques to design marketing strategies for a banking institution. The work includes data cleaning and exploration, customer segmentation, predictive modeling for credit approval, and the development of targeted campaigns for Classic, Gold, and Automotive credit products.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** — data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI** — dashboards, KPIs, and visual insights  
- **Orange Data Mining** — CN2, Decision Tree, ANN, Naive Bayes models  

## Key Findings
- Identification of key variables: cliente_cde, segmento, escolaridad, tipo vivienda..  
- Conversion of the numerical variable **edad** into a descriptive **rango_edad** attribute using Excel formulas.  
- CN2 model selected for interpretability.  
- Ideal customer segments identified for each credit product.  
- Notable insight: **95% of Medium A clients keep the Classic Card without migrating to other products.**

## Campaigns Designed
- **Tu esfuerzo merece más** — Gold Card  
- **Tu Historia es tu aval** — Classic Card  
- **Libertad en Movimiento** — Automotive Loan  
- **Iniciando con el Pie Derecho** — Classic Card for young/first-time clients
