# Data-Driven Marketing Strategy for Banking Products

University project focused on applying data mining techniques to design marketing strategies for a banking institution. The work includes data cleaning and exploration, customer segmentation, predictive modeling for credit approval, and the development of targeted campaigns for Classic, Gold, and Automotive credit products.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** — data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI** — dashboards, KPIs, and visual insights  
- **Orange Data Mining** — CN2, Decision Tree, ANN, Naive Bayes models  

## Key Findings
- Identification of key variables: cliente_cde, segmento, escolaridad, tipo vivienda..  
- Conversion of the numerical variable **edad** into a descriptive **rango_edad** attribute using Excel formulas.  
- CN2 model selected for interpretability.  
- Ideal customer segments identified for each credit product.  
- Notable insight: **95% of Medium A clients keep the Classic Card without migrating to other products.**

## Campaigns Designed
- **Tu esfuerzo merece más** — Gold Card  
- **Tu Historia es tu aval** — Classic Card  
- **Libertad en Movimiento** — Automotive Loan  
- **Iniciando con el Pie Derecho** — Classic Card for young/first-time clients

## Responsibilities and Contributions
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Executed dataset cleaning, variable standardization, outlier handling, and transformation based on initial exploratory analysis.
- Created new analytical attributes such as 'rango_edad', and prepared the dataset used for modeling.

### Predictive Model Development (Final Model)
- Built and validated the final predictive model in Orange Data Mining.
- Developed and compared multiple models, including CN2 rule induction, ANN, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
- Selected the best-performing and most interpretable model for the project (CN2).

### Power BI Dashboard Development
- Designed and implemented the complete Power BI dashboard from scratch.
- Built all KPIs, DAX measures, filters, interactions, and custom segment insights.
- Created visuals for customer profiling, approval distribution, socio-economic segmentation, and product performance.

### Marketing Strategy 
- Co-designed the marketing layout and campaign strategy for **Tarjeta Oro**.
 - Collaborated on message development, customer targeting, and visual alignment.
### Team Leadership
- Led the team’s workflow, assigned responsibilities, consolidated final deliverables, and ensured a consistent analytical direction across all phases of the project.
 ## Python Part 
 Alongside the original university project, I developed an additional Python notebook to replicate and automate part of the data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
This exercise was created independently after completing the project, with the goal of strengthening my skills in:
- dataset preparation 
- variable filtering and transformation
- creation of derived attributes (rangoedad)
- exploratory visualizations 
The notebook follows the same marketing analysis logic used in Excel and Power BI, but fully implemented in Python to improve reproducibility and deepen data manipulation skills.
